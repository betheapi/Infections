This project explores Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) using SQL for data cleaning and Power BI for insights and visualizations. The goal is to understand trends, identify potential risk factors, and demonstrate how BI can support better healthcare decisions.

📌 Objectives
Upload and analyze a real-world healthcare dataset

Clean messy data using SQL

Build interactive dashboards using Power BI

Highlight trends in infection rates across hospitals/states

Show proficiency in handling real data from end to end


🧹 Data Cleaning Process (Coming Soon)
The raw dataset contains:

✅ No duplicates

⚠️ Missing values across some columns (TBD)

Cleaning will involve:

Identifying and quantifying missing values

Deciding how to handle nulls (e.g., drop, fill)

Ensuring column types are correct

Filtering and transforming for dashboard use

🛠️ Tools Used
SQL (PostgreSQL or SQLite)

Power BI

Excel (initial exploration)

Git & GitHub

📈 Visuals (Coming Soon)
Power BI dashboard will explore:

Infection rates by hospital & state

Year-over-year comparisons

Drilldowns by infection type

KPIs for benchmarking

💡 What I’m Demonstrating
Ability to handle messy real-world data

Use of SQL for cleaning and transformation

Storytelling through interactive dashboards

Clear documentation and repo organization
